## 0.5.0
* @piohhmy added the ability to browse the file tree with sublime tabs (right arrow will open files / expand folders)

## 0.3.1
* Added option to keep tab. Useful for tabs that you open from packages, or the Settings tab.

## 0.2.1
* Added DblClick support.  Users can now double click to open a tab which makes it not temporary.

* Made sublime-tabs actually work. (v.0.1 was a lemon due to Atom not being able to include git submodules)

## 0.1.1
* Fixed tabs not being "active"

* Tabs open temporarily
* Temp tabs will be marked with italics
